# Numerical-Methods-for-Financial-Derivatives

This repository contains assignments completed during the 'Numerical Methods for Financial Derivatives' course attended during Master's in Math Finance at UNCC

Each assignment had unique task as stated below

ASSIG1 - The Python code is to compute the prices of European Call and Put options using the famous Black-Scholes formulas while allowing for two specifications in the calculations of the standard normal cumulative distribution

ASSIG2 - To simulate the path of Stock Price using Euler discretization of a Stochastic differential equation

ASSIG3 - To simulate the call option value and put option value with Euler discretization of a Stochastic differential equation and compare it with analytical solution i.e. BSM equation for analytical solution

ASSIG4 - To simulate the value of American call option value and American put option value using Monte carlo simulation and Linear Reggression 1 method

ASSIG5 - To simulate the value of American call option value and American put option value using Monte carlo simulation and Linear Reggression 2 method

ASSIG6 & 7 - The objective of this Python program is to compute the prices of European calls and puts using Fourier transform techniques. Trapezoid rule is used for the summation. Conjugate properties are also used.

ASSIG8 - The objective of this Python program is to compute the solution of a tridiagonal matrix using the finite differences method. WE use the heat equation to solve for explicit or implicit solution.

ASSIG9 - The objective of this Python program is to compute the prices of European and American calls and puts using Finite Difference Methods(FDMs) and the closed form solutions. Every method has its pros and cons. We haveused Explicit, Implicit and Crank-Nicholson discretizationmethods to solve using differing algorithms such as Thomas, Brennan-Schwartz, SOR and PSOR. We have seen that American options are costlier than European counterparts using different methods. Also, we have calculated the absolute difference compared to the closed form, Black Scholes solution.
